# 6lowpanemulator - Emulator for IEEE 802.15.4(g) 6LoWPAN  

## Creating a wireless system emulation  
Yet to work on that, but for the time being we'll act as if we're using wireless simulation and after the presentation and the semester are over, work on this system to create a proper network simulator of my own.  

*Level 1:* Create a communication scheme showing what your system really is  
*Deadline:* Apr 9 2017  

*Level 2:* Write the entire system in python and add physical properties in the system
*Deadline:* May 10 2017  

*Level 3:* Add GUI and classes for standard motes, cryptographic hash families, also add the functionality to add a new mote, hash through GUI alone  
*Deadline:* June 10 2017  

*Level 4:* Run experiments for your algorithm and gather data, Design system for intra-PAN communication and its challenges  
*Deadline:* July 10 2017  

*Level 5:* Run experiments for intra-PAN communication and gather data for it, create a report and start working on changes needed in your solutions  
*Deadline:* August 10 2017  

Future developments shall be dependent on the state of the progress made until then.
